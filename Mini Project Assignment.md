**Mini Project Assignment**



Student Management System (CLI Based)



Background :



Programming Pathshala has recently started a new batch of students. Currently, all student records are maintained manually, making it difficult to search, update, and manage information.



As a Python Developer, your task is to build a Student Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The application should run entirely in the terminal (CLI) and should be menu-driven.



Your goal is to design the application in a clean, modular, and reusable way by applying everything you've learned in Python and OOP.





**Objective**



Develop a command-line application that allows an administrator to manage student records.



Each student should have:



Roll Number (Unique)

Name

Marks





**Functional Requirements** 



Your application should support the following operations:



1\. Add Student



Allow the user to enter



Roll Number

Name

Marks



Validation:



Roll Number must be unique.

Marks should be between 0 and 100.





2\. View All Students



Display all student records in a well-formatted manner.



Example:

\---------------------------------

Roll No : 101

Name    : Rahul

Marks   : 92

Grade   : A+

\---------------------------------



3\. Search Student



Search a student using Roll Number.



If found, display complete details.



Otherwise: Student Not Found





4\. Update Marks



Allow updating marks using Roll Number.



After updating, display ---- Marks Updated Successfully





5\. Delete Student



Delete a student using Roll Number.



Display : Student Deleted Successfully



(if found)



Otherwise : Student Not Found



6\. Display Topper



Show the student with the highest marks



7\. Exit



Terminate the application.







**Grade Criteria**



Calculate grade based on marks.





| Marks    | Grade |

| -------- | ----- |

| 90–100   | A+    |

| 80–89    | A     |

| 70–79    | B     |

| 60–69    | C     |

| 40–59    | D     |

| Below 40 | Fail  |

**6. Show Topper**

**7. Exit**



**Enter your choice:**





**Technical Requirements** :

Students must use the following concepts:



Classes \& Objects

Constructors (\_\_init\_\_)

Instance Variables

Instance Methods

Class Variables

@classmethod

@staticmethod

Lists of Objects

Loops

Conditional Statements

Functions

if \_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_main\_\_"







**Constraints :**

Do not use dictionaries to store student data.

Every student must be an object.

Store all student objects inside a list.

The program should continue running until the user selects Exit.

Write clean, modular, and readable code.
